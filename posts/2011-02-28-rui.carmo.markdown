### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Rui Carmo](http://carmo.io "Rui's About.me page."), a happy dad, random coder, occasional designer, hobby photographer and, professionally, a systems engineer with marketing experience who's worked in telecoms for nearly fifteen years as an undercover Mac user (and who's been in the Mac world for quite a bit longer than that) and later joined Microsoft as a cloud architect.

At the time I was first intervied (in 2011) I was adjusting to a major career shift: after a decade at a major global telco doing a mix of engineering and marketing, I decided I wanted to go back into _doing_ stuff instead of sitting around waiting for vendors to get their act together and moved to [SAPO](http://www.sapo.pt "A web portal for Portugal.") (Portugal's major internet portal) where I herded an unlikely (but awesome) combination of teams doing (web) design, Big Data and collaborative tools. I had a blast there, and those people are still my extended family, even though most of us moved on.

These days I work at Microsoft (mostly with enterprise customers), so I've gone through a bunch of changes in my setup.

### What hardware do you use?

I main machine back in 2011 was a [Mac Mini][mac-mini] with 4GB of RAM and three monitors - two Dell 23" and a mongrel Samsung 17", this last one via a DisplayLink USB adapter that the guys there kindly mailed me a few years before. I dearly loved that little adapter, since it was nothing short of magical to be able to plug in an extra monitor via USB.

Since my transition to Microsoft in late 2015, I started carrying a Surface Pro (which I'm now upgrading to a newer Surface Laptop for extra performance while retaining portability) and work mostly remote from both home and customer premises.

At home I have a little menagerie of Apple hardware and ARM servers - I moved from a multiple monitor setup with a 2009 Mac Mini driving two 22" Samsung monitors to a 27" 5K iMac with an external 4K display (so I did get closer to my dream setup back in 2011), retired my G4 mini and 2008 unibody [MacBook][] in favor of a bunch of ARM development boards and a 2016 MacBook Pro that has (until now) remained mercifully free of any significant keyboard hassles (knock on wood).

These are waited upon by the usual amounts of magic rodents, silvered bath tiles, of which I'll spare you the details.

On the go, I have a progressively made my way to carrying both an [iPhone XS][] and a [Samsung S8][] (which I use mostly as a router), and stuck to using a Wi-Fi [iPad mini][] as (to all intents and purposes), my main _personal_ computer and the one I carry with me almost everywhere.

This has a little extra background to it - when we had kids I got used to switching off my phone after dinner, so the iPod became my little pocket computer. Its size and resilience makes it perfect for reading news over breakfast or when nursing kids to sleep. As time moved on, the [iPad mini][] gradually took over and became my "most personal" device, and I am thankful that Apple saw it fit to upgrade it in 2019, since it is (by far) the best form factor for me.

I also have an embarrassing amount of USB storage and network hardware that I've put together over the years, of which only a small portion is online now - Wi-Fi coverage and file and print serving is done by three [Airport Extreme][airport-extreme] base stations (all 5GHz 802.11n capable) linked via an unlikely mix of Cat. 5 cabling and powerline adapters, an Apple TV 4K as home multimedia hub, and an ODROID U2 development board as a HomeKit/home automation gateway.

That little machine is the network's Swiss Army Knife - it's an SSH gateway, web server for sending Wake-on-LAN packets to other machines remotely, Docker host for all my home automation glue (with ZigBee and custom ESP8266 hacks spread around the house, MQTT server - you name it, I've probably squeezed it in (including, once, a complete copy of my web site for performance tuning).

### And what software?

On Windows, I stick to the Office suite, [VS Code][], and (thankfully) the Windows Subsystem For Linux, which is where I do all of my work inside of an [Ubuntu][] userland. 90% of my day is spent with [Firefox][] and a terminal window open, the former with tabs for the Azure portal, Outlook (the web version has become more than good enough for daily use), [Databricks][] (managed [Spark][]), [Jupyter][] notebooks, etc., and the latter with [vim][] and the Azure CLI.

Despite being at Microsoft I am still a Mac user, and even then I've always been a UNIX user, and as such I tend to stick to software that works everywhere - most of my staples are old chestnuts like [vim][], [tmux][] and similarly crufty tools from bygone eras. On the Mac, the stuff that ships with [OSX][macos] ([Mail][], [Safari][], [Xcode][], etc.) is mostly fine.

But what I use daily depends mostly on context, and most of what I do is, actually, juggling those contexts. I'm long past the GTD mania and into pragmatism but needed something that worked across all of my devices, so I moved from [Evernote][] to [OneNote][] even before I moved to Microsoft (where I do a lot of drafting, note taking and filing) and [OneDrive][] to manage a number of work and personal projects across all my machines.

I still use the utterly amazing [Dropbox][] to keep everything else together, including my personal website.

In a work context, I obviously rely on [Office][office] for documents - it has long been the only sane choice in a corporate environment, although I also use [iWork][] for some personal stuff - mostly [Keynote][], of course, which is brilliant for short presentations, although not so much when you need more structure and custom master slides.

For graphics, and despite having had to put up with [Adobe Creative Suite][creative-suite] for reviewing assets for many years, I prefer using a number of smaller, nimbler tools like [OmniGraffle][], [Pixelmator][] and [Sketch][].

At home, I routinely stick my Surface onto a makeshift dock and use Remote Desktop to use it from my iMac's glorous 5K+4K setup, which works wonderfully for me as long as I remember to keep audio mapped to its microphone/speaker array for conference calls (it's a glorious hack, and one that has served me well for years now).

This allows me to flick two fingers to switch between Windows and the Mac, and the cloud-centric nature of my work lends itself beautifully to that--the hardware has become mostly irrelevant, except when I need some Windows-specific tool (which is rarer and rarer).

On my Mac, I still rely on the awesome [MenuMeters][], but have added other tools over time, such as [Moom][] for window tiling and [MsgFiler][] for quickly dealing with personal e-mail.

For those rare occasions when I absolutely must use some other OS, I just fire up an Azure VM, or resort to a KVM server I have set up with an i7 board that I used as a Hackintosh for a brief period.

On the go, my iOS app list goes a bit beyond the typical social junklets such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc.:

* [Dropbox][dropbox-ios] and [OneDrive][] were (of course) subsumed by Apple's Files app, but they're still there
* [Outlook][] (as much out of necessity as out of usefulness, since it is now tied to LinkedIn as well)
* [OneNote][] (I use it at least as much on the move as on the desktop)
* [Reeder][reeder-ios] for reading my RSS feeds (I've yet to try the Mac app, but if it is half as good, it's a winner)
* [Pocket][] for reading stuff, you know... later, since [Instapaper][instapaper-ios] is less useful now that I use Firefox a lot on Windows
* [Working Copy][] for editing code on the go (along with [Textastic][] and [Pythonista][], either of which is brilliant in its own way)
* [Prompt][], [Blink Shell][] and [Jump Desktop][] for accessing other machines

### What would be your dream setup?

I actually believe I'm pretty close to my dream setup already - I still like the current mix of cloud services and native apps on the platforms I use, so a lightweight device like the iPad and a beefed-up desktop with big screens cover most of my needs. 

Having been a Citrix user for many years, I'm perfectly adjusted to using VNC or Remote desktop to work on other machines, and that is now mostly the default way of working for me, so things have significantly improved over the years.

Having _that_ bit of software with a slightly higher resolution iPad (like a Pro) would probably be more than enough for 70-80% of my needs - in fact, I've had a few occasions where I've balanced a Bluetooth keyboard and an iPad on my lap (or desk, or whatever surface was handy) and typed away for hours, drafting stuff or logging in to remote machines (and isn't [vim][] handy...).

The trouble is that even now, more than eight years since the original interview, there are still all sorts of niggling issues with that - the Ctrl key doesn't work, you need third-party software, etc.

But the 11" [iPad Pro][] remains terribly compelling - and if I had to change just one thing on my current setup, it would definitely be getting _that_ for home use.

If I were to go completely overboard, then a 13" iPad, upgrading to an iMac Pro and two extra 27" displays would be about perfect, but I'd need a bigger desk - and, more importantly, time to sit there.

Any dream setup ought to include copious amounts of time to enjoy it, regardless of hardware details.
